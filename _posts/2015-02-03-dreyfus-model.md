I've just finished reading the first chapter of [_Pragmatic Thinking & Learning: Refactoring Your Wetware_](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning) by [Andy Hunt](http://andy.pragprog.com/). In this chapter he introduces the Dreyfus Model, a construct theory formalised in the 1970s which proposes five levels of skill acquisition: ___Novice___, ___Advanced Beginner___, ___Competent___, ___Proficient___ and ___Expert___. 

From my reading it's apparent that by understanding the lessons of the Dreyfus Model, organizations might better contemplate how to create environments which maximise potential expertise development, retention and capitalization. It might also help you, the individual, better consider how to interoperate and collaborate with those around you.

# The 5 stages

Each stage describes the level of mastery acquired in any given skill. It does not relate to the abilities of the individual in general. Frank might be a proficient cook, but he might also be a novice pianist.

The stages are defined as follows:  

___Novices___ need context-free rules to follow and achievable short-term goals. They will not know how to deal with mistakes should they arise. They will consider all perceived facets to a problem, regardless of whether they are actually relevant. They will not appreciate the impact they have on a particular system and will likely find the bigger picture overwhelming.

___Advanced Beginners___ start to bend and adapt the rules a little. They want information fast, although they still don't consider the wider context.

___Competents___ can solve problems themselves, and actively seek and apply advice from experts. They are often considered 'resourceful', and to be those who 'show initiative'.

___Proficients___ can reflect on and improve their approach, and can apply maxims in context. They will find over-simplified information frustrating.

___Experts___ work from intuition, not reason. As such they often struggle to articulate their thought process to others, they 'just know'. They are fully capable of differentiating those factors in a given problem which are relevant from those that are not. They see themselves as part of the system, rather than as detached observers.

In her 1982 paper on the nursing profession '_From Novice to Expert_', Dr Patricia Benner noted that this journey from novice to expert entails:

* a move from rules to intuition
* a realisation that only certain parts of the problem are relevant
* a realisation that individuals are integral to the system, not disconnected bystanders

# Expertise distribution

Further studies have shown that regardless of the skill in question, the individual or their age, the stage we are most likely to be at is Advanced Beginner. Few of us will progress beyond this point in most skills. For any given skill, the actual expertise distribution typically looks something like this*:

What are the sorts of factors that would stop people making it past Advanced Beginner?

One such factor is _metacognitive ability_ (or lack thereof) - how good are we at judging ourselves? It turns out we're naturally pretty bad, and invariably tend to succumb to the [_Dunning-Kruger effect_](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunningâ€“Kruger_effect). This means that when we're not particularly good at something, we tend to view ourselves as being more competent than we actually are. Incidentally the converse also seems to apply: as we become more proficient in something, we become more aware of just how little we know.

This _second-order incompetence_, where we naturally fail to recognize our own ineptitude, is a real barrier to progression. To my mind, arrogance exacerbates this phenomenon.

Other factors that inhibit progression are more environmental in nature. In terms of the software development industry today, Andy Hunt draws a fascinating parallel with the crisis faced by the nursing industry in the 1980s, the focus of the aforementioned study by Dr Benner. She observed the following:

* Nurses were often treated as a mere commodity; homogenous resources who were expected to follow doctors' orders.
* Pay inequality meant that many more skilled nurses were ultimately leaving the profession for management or teaching.
* Nursing education was suffering from an over-reliance on formal methods and tools.
* The profession as a whole had lost sight of what really mattered: patient outcomes.

If you've spent any amount of time in software development, you'll instantly recognize that these same sorts of problems prevail in the industry today. 

# Dr Benner's recommendations

These issues represent significant missed opportunities. As Andy does in his book, I will tailor some of the recommendations made by Dr Benner to the nursing profession in the 1980s, for the software development industry:

* ___Accept Responsibility___. Developers need to start recognizing the role they play in securing a positive outcome for the customer and taking responsibility for their actions.

Andy cited a particular study conducted in the medial profession where nurses were called by bogus doctors and instructed to give a patient a particular dose of a drug. Despite the fact that:
    * the drug was not on the approved list
    * the instruction was given over the phone, not in writing
    * the prescribed dosage was double the recommended amount
    * the doctor was unknown to the nurse
95% of nurses blindly followed the instructions given. In my last job I would see this sort of thing happen _daily_. At best it's negligent, at worst it's dangerous. 

This means we need more people at the competent level. To achieve this we need more good exemplars in the environment.

* ___Retain Expertise___. Organizations need to recognize and reward the value individuals with particular expertise bring. Consider any high-performing sports team: although the manager is well-paid and respected, it's often star players who are paid the most, in recognition of their contribution.   

* ___Beware the tool trap___. Strict enforcement of specific tools and methodologies frustrates experts and stifles creativity, invention and intuition. In particular avoid:
    * Legislating behaviour that contradicts individual autonomy.
    * Alienating experienced practitioners in favour of novices.
    * Spelling out too much detail.
    * Oversimplification of complex situations.
    * Demand for excessive conformity.
    * Insensitivity to contextual nuances.

# One size does not fit all

The Dreyfus model highlights the conditions that individuals at different stages of expertise will require to flourish.

Novices need quick successes. Don't confuse them with the bigger picture, give them support and context-free rules. Experts on the other hand don't want to be bogged down with bureaucracy and guidelines. Give them the freedom to express their opinions and insight - you want to benefit from their expertise.

By the way, experts don't necessarily make good teachers. Teaching is a skill in its own right. As we've seen, experts sometimes have a hard time explaining the rationale behind particular decisions, they tend to just have a (reliable) gut-feel. As such, you might have better luck pairing Novices with Advanced Beginners or Competents, as they'll better understand and be more tolerant of the stricter rules they'll need to follow.

In his book, Andy also recommends balancing teams with individuals at different levels. He argues that Experts have a tendency to disagree with one another, and it can be useful to have one or two people on the team who are not necessarily so focussed on the bigger picture.

I recommend you go read [his book](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning) :-).
